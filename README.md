## About #article - {Developers Journal}

To learn something you need something and when you need something we offer something that is #articles where others not like you offer something that exactly match the something that you need to learn. 
```
> in-short () {
    search(something){
        return ( found = DB::#articles()->match(something) ? found : 'we are sorry that we don't able to provide you that "something".
        if you find it let us know!'); 
    }
} 
```
If you also love coding or want to contribute in this project {I M READY TO HELP}!

We have to create a pre-defined set of rules for getting and processing the data. Moreover, a global state has to be attached from all the components which is currenty not the case. We have to make :
1. Global Authentication Holder with guarded routes
2. Global Entities Getters,Mutators that will handled all the data we need with propers destruction when its not useful for better processing of things 
3. Improving Structure of components dependencies on one another

These three main tasks must fullfilled before moving on... but the situation is that it requires to re-wire,deep-constructing the whole project that cost time!

working on these tasks!
